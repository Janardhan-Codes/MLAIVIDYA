# Student Performance Prediction – Machine Learning Assignment

## Dataset
Student Performance Dataset from Kaggle

## Project 1: Linear Regression
- Loaded and explored dataset
- Performed encoding
- Built baseline Linear Regression model
- Evaluated using R² and MAE

## Project 2: Random Forest Regressor
- Trained advanced model
- Compared with Linear Regression
- Observed improved performance

## Key Learnings
- End-to-end ML workflow
- Importance of data preprocessing
- Trade-offs between simple and complex models


## Reflection

- The advanced model improved prediction accuracy compared to Linear Regression.
- The most challenging part was understanding feature encoding.
- I spent approximately 8–10 hours completing this assignment.
